The  \\nU.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the \\nsurvey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of \\ninterview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, \\ntherefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive \\nhealth insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a \\ndifferent concept than the measure based on the Current Population \\nSurvey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). \\nFor reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance \\ncoverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines \\nprivate health insurance as a plan provided through an employer \\nor a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an \\ninsurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare.\\ngov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage \\nincludes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state \\nhealth plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program \\nat the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are \\nconsidered insured if they were covered by any of these types \\nof health insurance at time of interview. People are considered \\nuninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health \\ninsurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through \\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered \\ncomprehensive.\\n* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition \\nexcludes single-service plans, such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or prescription \\nmedicine plans.The large sample size of the ACS \\nallows for an examination of the \\nuninsured rate and coverage by \\ntype for subnational geographies.8\\nKey Findings\\n• In 2022, the uninsured rate \\nvaried from 2.4 percent in \\nMassachusetts to 16.6 percent \\nin Texas (Figure 1 and Figure \\n2). The District of Columbia \\nwas among the lowest with an \\nuninsured rate of 2.9 percent, \\nnot statistically different from \\nMassachusetts.\\n• Utah and North Dakota reported \\nthe highest rate of private cov -\\nerage (78.4 percent) in 2022, \\nwhile New Mexico had the low -\\nest private coverage rate (54.4 \\npercent) (Figure 3).9\\n• Utah had the lowest rate of \\npublic coverage in 2022 (22.2 \\npercent), and New Mexico had \\nthe highest (Figure 4). \\n• Twenty-seven states had lower \\nuninsured rates in 2022 com -\\npared with 2021. Maine was the \\nonly state whose uninsured rate \\nincreased (6.6 percent in 2022, \\nup from 5.7 percent in 2021) \\n(Figure 1 and Appendix Table \\nB-1).\\n• From 2021 to 2022, 13 states \\nreported increases in public cov -\\nerage, with only Rhode Island \\nreporting a decrease of 2.2 \\npercentage points (Appendix \\nTable B-3).\\n8 The Current Population Survey Annual \\nSocial and Economic Supplement (CPS \\nASEC) is the leading source of national level \\nestimates of health insurance coverage. For a \\ncomparison of ACS and CPS ASEC measures \\nof health insurance coverage, refer to < www.\\ncensus.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/\\nguidance.html >.\\n9 Respondents may have more than one \\nhealth insurance coverage type at the time \\nof interview. As a result, adding the total \\nnumber of people with private coverage and \\nthe total number with public coverage will \\nsum to more than the total number with any \\ncoverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states \\nreported increases in private \\ncoverage, while seven reported \\ndecreases (Appendix Table B-2). \\nDIFFERENCES IN THE \\nUNINSURED RATE BY STATE \\nIN 2022\\nIn 2022, uninsured rates at the \\ntime of interview ranged across \\nstates from a low of 2.4 percent \\nin Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 \\npercent in Texas, compared to the \\nnational rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten \\nof the 15 states with uninsured \\n10 The uninsured rates in the District \\nof Columbia and Massachusetts were not \\nstatistically different.rates above the national aver -\\nage were states that have not \\nexpanded Medicaid eligibility, and \\ntwo of those 15 states, Oklahoma \\n(11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 \\npercent), had recently expanded \\nMedicaid eligibility in 2022.11 \\nTwenty-nine states and the District \\nof Columbia had an uninsured \\nrate below the national average. \\n11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, \\n2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia \\nelected to expand Medicaid eligibility under \\nthe ACA.

The  \\nU.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the \\nsurvey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of \\ninterview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, \\ntherefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive \\nhealth insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a \\ndifferent concept than the measure based on the Current Population \\nSurvey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). \\nFor reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance \\ncoverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines \\nprivate health insurance as a plan provided through an employer \\nor a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an \\ninsurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare.\\ngov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage \\nincludes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state \\nhealth plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program \\nat the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are \\nconsidered insured if they were covered by any of these types \\nof health insurance at time of interview. People are considered \\nuninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health \\ninsurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through \\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered \\ncomprehensive.\\n* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition \\nexcludes single-service plans, such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or prescription \\nmedicine plans.The large sample size of the ACS \\nallows for an examination of the \\nuninsured rate and coverage by \\ntype for subnational geographies.8\\nKey Findings\\n• In 2022, the uninsured rate \\nvaried from 2.4 percent in \\nMassachusetts to 16.6 percent \\nin Texas (Figure 1 and Figure \\n2). The District of Columbia \\nwas among the lowest with an \\nuninsured rate of 2.9 percent, \\nnot statistically different from \\nMassachusetts.\\n• Utah and North Dakota reported \\nthe highest rate of private cov -\\nerage (78.4 percent) in 2022, \\nwhile New Mexico had the low -\\nest private coverage rate (54.4 \\npercent) (Figure 3).9\\n• Utah had the lowest rate of \\npublic coverage in 2022 (22.2 \\npercent), and New Mexico had \\nthe highest (Figure 4). \\n• Twenty-seven states had lower \\nuninsured rates in 2022 com -\\npared with 2021. Maine was the \\nonly state whose uninsured rate \\nincreased (6.6 percent in 2022, \\nup from 5.7 percent in 2021) \\n(Figure 1 and Appendix Table \\nB-1).\\n• From 2021 to 2022, 13 states \\nreported increases in public cov -\\nerage, with only Rhode Island \\nreporting a decrease of 2.2 \\npercentage points (Appendix \\nTable B-3).\\n8 The Current Population Survey Annual \\nSocial and Economic Supplement (CPS \\nASEC) is the leading source of national level \\nestimates of health insurance coverage. For a \\ncomparison of ACS and CPS ASEC measures \\nof health insurance coverage, refer to < www.\\ncensus.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/\\nguidance.html >.\\n9 Respondents may have more than one \\nhealth insurance coverage type at the time \\nof interview. As a result, adding the total \\nnumber of people with private coverage and \\nthe total number with public coverage will \\nsum to more than the total number with any \\ncoverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states \\nreported increases in private \\ncoverage, while seven reported \\ndecreases (Appendix Table B-2). \\nDIFFERENCES IN THE \\nUNINSURED RATE BY STATE \\nIN 2022\\nIn 2022, uninsured rates at the \\ntime of interview ranged across \\nstates from a low of 2.4 percent \\nin Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 \\npercent in Texas, compared to the \\nnational rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten \\nof the 15 states with uninsured \\n10 The uninsured rates in the District \\nof Columbia and Massachusetts were not \\nstatistically different.rates above the national aver -\\nage were states that have not \\nexpanded Medicaid eligibility, and \\ntwo of those 15 states, Oklahoma \\n(11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 \\npercent), had recently expanded \\nMedicaid eligibility in 2022.11 \\nTwenty-nine states and the District \\nof Columbia had an uninsured \\nrate below the national average. \\n11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, \\n2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia \\nelected to expand Medicaid eligibility under \\nthe ACA.

The  \\nU.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the \\nsurvey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of \\ninterview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, \\ntherefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive \\nhealth insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a \\ndifferent concept than the measure based on the Current Population \\nSurvey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). \\nFor reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance \\ncoverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines \\nprivate health insurance as a plan provided through an employer \\nor a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an \\ninsurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare.\\ngov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage \\nincludes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state \\nhealth plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program \\nat the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are \\nconsidered insured if they were covered by any of these types \\nof health insurance at time of interview. People are considered \\nuninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health \\ninsurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through \\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered \\ncomprehensive.\\n* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition \\nexcludes single-service plans, such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or prescription \\nmedicine plans.The large sample size of the ACS \\nallows for an examination of the \\nuninsured rate and coverage by \\ntype for subnational geographies.8\\nKey Findings\\n• In 2022, the uninsured rate \\nvaried from 2.4 percent in \\nMassachusetts to 16.6 percent \\nin Texas (Figure 1 and Figure \\n2). The District of Columbia \\nwas among the lowest with an \\nuninsured rate of 2.9 percent, \\nnot statistically different from \\nMassachusetts.\\n• Utah and North Dakota reported \\nthe highest rate of private cov -\\nerage (78.4 percent) in 2022, \\nwhile New Mexico had the low -\\nest private coverage rate (54.4 \\npercent) (Figure 3).9\\n• Utah had the lowest rate of \\npublic coverage in 2022 (22.2 \\npercent), and New Mexico had \\nthe highest (Figure 4). \\n• Twenty-seven states had lower \\nuninsured rates in 2022 com -\\npared with 2021. Maine was the \\nonly state whose uninsured rate \\nincreased (6.6 percent in 2022, \\nup from 5.7 percent in 2021) \\n(Figure 1 and Appendix Table \\nB-1).\\n• From 2021 to 2022, 13 states \\nreported increases in public cov -\\nerage, with only Rhode Island \\nreporting a decrease of 2.2 \\npercentage points (Appendix \\nTable B-3).\\n8 The Current Population Survey Annual \\nSocial and Economic Supplement (CPS \\nASEC) is the leading source of national level \\nestimates of health insurance coverage. For a \\ncomparison of ACS and CPS ASEC measures \\nof health insurance coverage, refer to < www.\\ncensus.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/\\nguidance.html >.\\n9 Respondents may have more than one \\nhealth insurance coverage type at the time \\nof interview. As a result, adding the total \\nnumber of people with private coverage and \\nthe total number with public coverage will \\nsum to more than the total number with any \\ncoverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states \\nreported increases in private \\ncoverage, while seven reported \\ndecreases (Appendix Table B-2). \\nDIFFERENCES IN THE \\nUNINSURED RATE BY STATE \\nIN 2022\\nIn 2022, uninsured rates at the \\ntime of interview ranged across \\nstates from a low of 2.4 percent \\nin Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 \\npercent in Texas, compared to the \\nnational rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten \\nof the 15 states with uninsured \\n10 The uninsured rates in the District \\nof Columbia and Massachusetts were not \\nstatistically different.rates above the national aver -\\nage were states that have not \\nexpanded Medicaid eligibility, and \\ntwo of those 15 states, Oklahoma \\n(11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 \\npercent), had recently expanded \\nMedicaid eligibility in 2022.11 \\nTwenty-nine states and the District \\nof Columbia had an uninsured \\nrate below the national average. \\n11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, \\n2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia \\nelected to expand Medicaid eligibility under \\nthe ACA. The 12 states that had not expanded \\nMedicaid eligibility under the ACA on or \\nbefore January 1, 2021, included Alabama, \\nFlorida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North \\nCarolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, \\nTennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. \\nFor more information on expansion states, \\nrefer to Appendix Table A-1.\\n\\nHealth Insurance Coverage Status and Type \\nby Geography: 2021 and 2022\\nAmerican Community Survey Briefs\\nACSBR-015Issued September 2023Douglas Conway and Breauna Branch\\nINTRODUCTION\\nDemographic shifts as well as economic and govern-\\nment policy changes can affect people’s access to health coverage. For example, between 2021 and 2022, the labor market continued to improve, which may have affected private coverage in the United States \\nduring that time.\\n1 Public policy changes included \\nthe renewal of the Public Health Emergency, which \\nallowed Medicaid enrollees to remain covered under the Continuous Enrollment Provision.\\n2 The American \\nRescue Plan (ARP) enhanced Marketplace premium subsidies for those with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level as well as for unemployed people.\\n3\\nIn addition to national policies, individual states and the District of Columbia can affect health insurance coverage by making Marketplace or Medicaid more accessible and affordable. This variation may be more or less pronounced across states.

The  \\nU.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the \\nsurvey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of \\ninterview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, \\ntherefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive \\nhealth insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a \\ndifferent concept than the measure based on the Current Population \\nSurvey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). \\nFor reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance \\ncoverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines \\nprivate health insurance as a plan provided through an employer \\nor a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an \\ninsurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare.\\ngov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage \\nincludes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state \\nhealth plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program \\nat the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are \\nconsidered insured if they were covered by any of these types \\nof health insurance at time of interview. People are considered \\nuninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health \\ninsurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through \\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered \\ncomprehensive.\\n* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition \\nexcludes single-service plans, such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or prescription \\nmedicine plans.The large sample size of the ACS \\nallows for an examination of the \\nuninsured rate and coverage by \\ntype for subnational geographies.8\\nKey Findings\\n• In 2022, the uninsured rate \\nvaried from 2.4 percent in \\nMassachusetts to 16.6 percent \\nin Texas (Figure 1 and Figure \\n2). The District of Columbia \\nwas among the lowest with an \\nuninsured rate of 2.9 percent, \\nnot statistically different from \\nMassachusetts.\\n• Utah and North Dakota reported \\nthe highest rate of private cov -\\nerage (78.4 percent) in 2022, \\nwhile New Mexico had the low -\\nest private coverage rate (54.4 \\npercent) (Figure 3).9\\n• Utah had the lowest rate of \\npublic coverage in 2022 (22.2 \\npercent), and New Mexico had \\nthe highest (Figure 4). \\n• Twenty-seven states had lower \\nuninsured rates in 2022 com -\\npared with 2021. Maine was the \\nonly state whose uninsured rate \\nincreased (6.6 percent in 2022, \\nup from 5.7 percent in 2021) \\n(Figure 1 and Appendix Table \\nB-1).\\n• From 2021 to 2022, 13 states \\nreported increases in public cov -\\nerage, with only Rhode Island \\nreporting a decrease of 2.2 \\npercentage points (Appendix \\nTable B-3).\\n8 The Current Population Survey Annual \\nSocial and Economic Supplement (CPS \\nASEC) is the leading source of national level \\nestimates of health insurance coverage. For a \\ncomparison of ACS and CPS ASEC measures \\nof health insurance coverage, refer to < www.\\ncensus.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/\\nguidance.html >.\\n9 Respondents may have more than one \\nhealth insurance coverage type at the time \\nof interview. As a result, adding the total \\nnumber of people with private coverage and \\nthe total number with public coverage will \\nsum to more than the total number with any \\ncoverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states \\nreported increases in private \\ncoverage, while seven reported \\ndecreases (Appendix Table B-2). \\nDIFFERENCES IN THE \\nUNINSURED RATE BY STATE \\nIN 2022\\nIn 2022, uninsured rates at the \\ntime of interview ranged across \\nstates from a low of 2.4 percent \\nin Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 \\npercent in Texas, compared to the \\nnational rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten \\nof the 15 states with uninsured \\n10 The uninsured rates in the District \\nof Columbia and Massachusetts were not \\nstatistically different.rates above the national aver -\\nage were states that have not \\nexpanded Medicaid eligibility, and \\ntwo of those 15 states, Oklahoma \\n(11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 \\npercent), had recently expanded \\nMedicaid eligibility in 2022.11 \\nTwenty-nine states and the District \\nof Columbia had an uninsured \\nrate below the national average. \\n11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, \\n2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia \\nelected to expand Medicaid eligibility under \\nthe ACA.

The  \\nU.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the \\nsurvey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of \\ninterview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, \\ntherefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive \\nhealth insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a \\ndifferent concept than the measure based on the Current Population \\nSurvey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). \\nFor reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance \\ncoverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines \\nprivate health insurance as a plan provided through an employer \\nor a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an \\ninsurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare.\\ngov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage \\nincludes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state \\nhealth plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program \\nat the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are \\nconsidered insured if they were covered by any of these types \\nof health insurance at time of interview. People are considered \\nuninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health \\ninsurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through \\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered \\ncomprehensive.\\n* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs.

This coverage can provide access to necessary medical treatments and services, and can help mitigate the financial burden of unexpected medical expenses.
